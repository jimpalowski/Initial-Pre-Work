# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.

When we first arrive to the website we are requesting the server address from the server. Then our information is exchanged with the server and after that we receive the page as requested. Once everything is passed through we are at the user interface.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

We have to make a request to the server by HTTP then the host has to translate our ip address to validate ourselves. Once the connection is open the server inspects the request and forwards our information to the server software. We get the information from the database and it gets sent back to us thus rendering the website. 

## What code is rendered in the browser?

The code rendered in the browser is Javascript and the HTML of the page.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

The server-side's main function is to collect information and to submit the users request as in making an account or changing the website.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

The client-side's main function is to handle to requests of the user as in clicking on links or logging in to the page.

## What is runtime?

Runtime is how long it takes for certain functions to be served for and the time for information to be passed around. It also means how long a program has been running for.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

There isn't a certain number of instances, but it all depends on what the user is doing as in personalizing the website to suit the users need or saving information.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

The instances are available at the users given time for when they search for something or when you submit a form.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

There are instances when the user is logging in that counts because we are retreiving information from the database to validate.
