// We defined two string variables and used the += operator to make a complete sentence.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "Fun";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
